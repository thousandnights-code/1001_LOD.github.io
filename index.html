	View source is a feature, not a bug. Thanks for your curiosity and
	interest in participating!

	Here are the submission guidelines for the new and improved csszengarden.com:

	- CSS3? Of course! Prefix for ALL browsers where necessary.
	- go responsive; test your layout at multiple screen sizes.
	- your browser testing baseline: IE9+, recent Chrome/Firefox/Safari, and iOS/Android
	- Graceful degradation is acceptable, and in fact highly encouraged.
	- use classes for styling. Don't use ids.
	- web fonts are cool, just make sure you have a license to share the files. Hosted 
	  services that are applied via the CSS file (ie. Google Fonts) will work fine, but
	  most that require custom HTML won't. TypeKit is supported, see the readme on this
	  page for usage instructions: https://github.com/mezzoblue/csszengarden.com/

	And a few tips on building your CSS file:

	- use :first-child, :last-child and :nth-child to get at non-classed elements
	- use ::before and ::after to create pseudo-elements for extra styling
	- use multiple background images to apply as many as you need to any element
	- use the Kellum Method for image replacement, if still needed. http://goo.gl/GXxdI
	- don't rely on the extra divs at the bottom. Use ::before and ::after instead.

			<p>The idea of linking different data related to the context of Middle-Eastern culture, was inspired by the concept of "intercultural meeting". One of the symbols of intercultural meeting is indeed the Persian medieval collection "One Thousand and One Nights" (also known as "Arabian Nights"). It is one of the most famous Middle-eastern literary work in the world, that inspired paintings, symphonic operas, literary works and even boardgames and movies, both in Eastern and Wester cultures. With the translation of the Arabian Nights tales in French, the fashion of "easternizing" the West began. The aim of this project is to find and describe the main concepts and entities related to One Thousand and One Nights: this was possible through the Linked Open Data available on the web.</p>

			<h3 id="partitle" style="color: #A9E2F3">Inside the legend</h3>
			<p style="color: #A9E2F3"><strong>One Thousand and One Nights (or "Arabian Nights") is a collection of Persian tales and legends. The manuscript is dated to the Middle Ages and the author (or authors) is unknown. The main character is the persian princess Sheherazade, who was bethroted to a cruel sultan, known for murdering every wife he had during his life. The sultan believed the women were untrustworthy and unfaithful. Eventually, Sheherazade was forced to marry the sultan, and, to save her own life, she came up with a clever plan: every night, she told the sultan different stories and legends, thus catching his attention. Thanks to Sheherazade's narrations, the sultan not only spares her life, but also falls in love with her. The tales she told him are in fact those encompassed in the collection of "Arabian Nights".</strong></p>

			<h3 style="color: #B3C4CF">What is LOD? How did it help in builing the project?</h3>
			<p style="color: #B3C4CF"><strong>LOD, or <em>Linked Open Data</em> is structured open data interlinked to other data. Internet is thought as a great global database, whose interlinked data are both human and machine readable (Semantic Web). The standards used to share, link, describe, retrieve and read data are web technologies such as RDF, HTTP, and URIs. As it was said above, the purpose of the project is in fact to describe and link the entities and concepts related to One Thousands and One Nights, with the help of Linked Open Data and of different web technologies.</strong></p>
		</div>

		<div class="explanation" id="zen-explanation" role="article">
			<h3 style="color: #B3C4CF">The Items</h3>
			<p style="color: #B3C4CF"><strong>In this section, ten items (such as music productions, tangible work of arts, manuscripts) related to Arabian Nights (and, more broadly, to Middle-Eastern culture) are presented and briefly described. They stand as existing examples of man-made productions displaying a process of intercultural meeting.</strong></p>
		</div>
		<div class="explanation" id="zen-explanation" role="article">
			<h3 style="color: #B3C4CF">Metadata Analysis</h3>
			<p style="color: #B3C4CF"><strong>Metadata is "data that describes other data". In this case metadata provides contextual information retrieval about the ten items selected. The items are fully described and aligned, thus creating dinamic links between entities. Data is described and classified following specific standards provided by authorities and institution (i.e. DublinCore (DC) for literary sources, ISBN code for books, and so on...)</strong></p>
		</div>
		

		<div class="explanation" id="zen-explanation" role="article">
			<h3 style="color: #B3C4CF">Metadata Alignment</h3>
			<p style="color: #B3C4CF"><strong>In this section, it is available the alignment table of the metadata describing the items.</strong></p>
		</div>

		<div class="explanation" id="zen-explanation" role="article">
			<h3 style="color: #B3C4CF">E/R Model</h3>
			<p style="color: #B3C4CF"><strong>The entity/relationship model describes interrelated things in a specific domain of knowledge. It is composed of entity types and specifies relationships that can exist between entities (existing things that can be either conceptual or physical).</strong></p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="explanation" id="zen-explanation" role="article">
			<h3 style="color: #B3C4CF">Theoretical Model</h3>
			<p style="color: #B3C4CF"><strong>The theoretical model is the abstract bridge between the E/R model and the Conceptual model. While the former represents the connection between real items and entities, the latter expresses these relationships in abstract and general terms.</strong></p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="explanation" id="zen-explanation" role="article">
			<h3 style="color: #B3C4CF">Theoretical Model graph</h3>
			<p style="color: #B3C4CF">The theoretical model graph is the visual representation of this process of abstraction and is useful to provide a conceptual model.</strong></p>
		</div>

		<div class="explanation" id="zen-explanation" role="article">
			<h3 style="color: #B3C4CF">Conceptual Model</h3>
			<p style="color: #B3C4CF"><strong>A place, a concept, a human being, an object can be linked to other entities and described. This can be done by answering to the fundamental questions "who/where/when and what". The ontologies are used to provide a formal definition of the categories, properties and relations between the concepts and entities encompassed in the domain.</strong></p>
		</div>

		<div class="explanation" id="zen-explanation" role="article">
			<h3 style="color: #B3C4CF">Data description, RDF serialization and Knowledge Graph</h3>
			<p style="color: #B3C4CF"><strong>In the sections "Data Description" and "RDF Serialization and Knowledge Graph", the RDF (resource description framework) web technology is used to describe some entities (resoruces) and their relations (properties). The serialized data are in both human and machine readble form, the format used is RDF/turtle. The knowledge graph is the graphical visualization showing interconnections between the subject and its multiple properties.</strong></p>
